Dates are approximate.
In this timeline, Ma means "million years ago", ka means "thousand years ago", and ya means "years ago".
4000 Ma and earlier.
4000 Ma – 2500 Ma
Bacteria develop primitive forms of photosynthesis which at first do not produce oxygen. These organisms generate ATP by exploiting a proton gradient, a mechanism still used in virtually all organisms.
2500 Ma – 542 Ma
542 Ma – present
The Phanerozoic Eon, literally the "period of well-displayed life", marks the appearance in the fossil record of abundant, shell-forming and/or trace-making organisms. It is subdivided into three eras, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which are divided by major mass extinctions.
542 Ma – 251.0 Ma
Four-limbed tetrapods gradually gain adaptations which will help them occupy a terrestrial life-habit.
