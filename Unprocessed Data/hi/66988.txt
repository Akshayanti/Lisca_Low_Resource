The Integrated Authority File or GND is an international authority file for the organisation of personal names, subject headings and corporate bodies from catalogues. It is used mainly for documentation in libraries and increasingly also by archives and museums. The GND is managed by the German National Library in cooperation with various library networks in German-speaking Europe and other partners. The GND falls under the Creative Commons Zero license.
The GND specification provides a hierarchy of high-level entities and sub-classes, useful in library classification, and an approach to unambiguous identification of single elements. It also comprises an ontology intended for knowledge representation in the semantic web, available in the RDF format.
The Integrated Authority File became operational in April 2012 and integrates the content of the following authority files which have since been discontinued:
At the time of its introduction, the GND holds 9,493,860 files, including 2,650,000 personalized names.
Other authority files are: Library of Congress Name Authority File by the Library of Congress, Web NDL Authorities by the National Diet Library, LIBRIS by the National Library of Sweden, and the Virtual International Authority File .
